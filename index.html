            <h1>Ghanian Naming culture.</h1>
            Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture.Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born.
            This application enables you to know your Akan name and the day of the week in which you were born according to the Ghanaian naming culture by you entering you date of birth,your monthbirth and your year of birth.
            <p>You are also required to verify whether you are a male or female since the Akan culture distinctively differentiates male names from female names.</p>
